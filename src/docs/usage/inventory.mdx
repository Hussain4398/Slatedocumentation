  ## What is inventory
  
  Each product or service (depending on the type of business) you list on your Slate store is part of your inventory. Your inventory keeps track of the number of units you have in stock. Each business has different products or services listed on their Slate stores. The simplest way to understand the different types of products or services different businesses can have is by using the following example: 
  
 <div align="center">
  
 |Type of store|Inventory product/service|
|:-----:|:--------------:|
|Resteraunt|Pepperoni Pizza|
|          |Margherita Pizza|
|Pharmacy|Paracetamol|
|       |Deep heat spray|
|       |Bandages|
|       |Gauze|
|Car wash|Standard wash|
|        |Wash + Buff|
  
  </div>
  
  if you're a resteraunt owner (or a home-based business) you will list the items on your menu on your Slate store such as a pizzeria will list different types of pizzas they have available on their menu. For a car wash owner (or a door to door car washing service) you will list the different type of services you offer.

  ## How to add an item
  
  Steps to add an item:
  
   - To add an item choose **Add Item**. This will open a side bar as shown in the image below. This is the start of how you add an item to your Slate store.
 
 <p align="center">  <img width="650" height="400" alt="[Screenshot 2022-03-30 at 3 59 27 PM]" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101874906/160824797-b3c6bc5b-b8c7-4c4c-9705-c1b2f02c06dc.png"> </p>
 
   - Name your item and add a description to continue. For our example we have added a pepperoni pizza for a pizzeria. 
   - You will now need to edit your item which includes the following: 
 
  - Choose a category the item falls under. This classifies the item you have uploaded. To learn more about how to create a category <Link to="/src/docs/usage/category">clik here.</Link>
  - Choosing an image to display for your item. This will be an image that you have uploaded to your **Media** section. To learn more about how to add media to your Slate store you can read this <Link to="/src/docs/usage/media">guide.</Link>
  - Create variation(s) for your item. The item is the shell and the content within it is variation. for example we are creating a pepperoni pizza for a pizza the variations for are; 8 inches, 12 inches and 16 inches, the sizes the resteraunt offers. Likewise, if you are a clothing store your variations for a crew neck T-shirt would be small, medium and large.

  ## How to add a variation
 
 - To create a variation choose **Add Variation**. 
 - Name the variation, add a SKU number, the price of the item and click the track inventory slider if you wish to keep track of your inventory. If yes, then choose the location the item is available at. 
 - Each item has to have a number of units available, for example if you're a clothing business and the number of white crew neck t-shirts in size medium is 45 then you will add 45 in stock. This is done by choosing **Select** under the **Actions** column in the variations table, choose **Update Stock**, choose **Increase** to add to the number of units available for your listed variant and the number that you have in stock.
