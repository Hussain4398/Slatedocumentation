 ## How to create an order
 
 Steps to create an order are:
 
 <a id="branch"></a> 
  - Choose the location you are generating the order from. For example if your store has 2 locations (such as Islamabad and Karachi) you will choose the location from which you will be fulfilling the order placed by your customer. If your customer is based in Karachi you would normally chose your store location as Karachi but there can be exceptions for example if the item you want to sell is available in your Islamabad store. If you only have one store (you are a home based business you will have one location).
